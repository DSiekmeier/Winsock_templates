## DESCRIPTION
This folder includes some very basic client / server examples using the Winsock
library. For beginners it might be useful to see the general structure of a
socket based communication. For more advanced developers maybe it safes some
time reinventing the wheel.
Contact me for any comments or improvements.

## COMPILE
Nothing special about it... but remember to link against libwsock32.

## TODO
- Do something with select()

## LICENCE
These source codes are under Coffee-Ware licence: feel free to use this software
"as-is", but buy me a coffee if we ever meet each other.
